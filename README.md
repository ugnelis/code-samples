## Java

### Algorithms

**Data Structures**

* [Linked List](java/algorithms/data_structures/LinkedList.java) is a data structure that represents a sequence of
  nodes. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each
  node pointers to both the next node and the previous node.
* [Queue](java/algorithms/data_structures/Queue.java) a stack of data. In certain types of problems, it can be favorable
  to store data in a stack rather than in an array
* [Stack](java/algorithms/data_structures/Stack.java) uses LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering. That is, as in a stack of
  dinner plates, the most recent item added to the stack is the first item to be removed.

**Games**

* [Sudoku](java/algorithms/games/Sudoku.java) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic
  sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3
  subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9

**Graphs**

* [Breadth-First Search](java/algorithms/graphs/BFS.java) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node
  that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to
  moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
* [Depth-First Search](java/algorithms/graphs/DFS.java) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data
  structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before
  backtracking.

**Math**

* [Greatest Common Divisor](java/algorithms/math/GCD_LCM.java)
* [Least Common Multiple](java/algorithms/math/GCD_LCM.java)
* [Sieve of Eratosthenes](java/algorithms/math/SieveOfEratosthenes.java)

**Recursion and Dynamic Programming*

* [Fibonacci](java/algorithms/recursion_and_dynamic_programming/Fibonacci.java)
* [Find number of sets that add up to given sum number](java/algorithms/recursion_and_dynamic_programming/FindSetsNumber.java)

**Searching**

* [Binary Search](java/algorithms/searching/BinarySearch.java)

**Sorts**

* [Bubble Sort](java/algorithms/sorts/BubbleSort.java)
* [Bucket Sort](java/algorithms/sorts/BucketSort.java)
* [Insertion Sort](java/algorithms/sorts/InsertionSort.java)
* [Merge Sort](java/algorithms/sorts/MergeSort.java)
* [Quick Sort](java/algorithms/sorts/QuickSort.java)
* [Radix Sort](java/algorithms/sorts/RadixSort.java)
